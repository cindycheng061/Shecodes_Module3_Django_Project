## Appreciation
Thank you Lead Mentor Carlie and Harry for your guidance and support throughout the project!

A big thank you to Mentors Reece, Ling, Aiden, and Chris for your valuable assistance and encouragement.

Without all of you, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish all of this. As someone with zero coding background, I'm proud of what I have achieved so far.

Although there were moments of feeling overwhelmed and uncertainties, I've come a long way since the beginning of the project. I'm determined to continue working on the code and complete all the planned features.

Thank you all once again for being amazing mentors and making Django journey possible!
